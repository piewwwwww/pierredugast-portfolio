    <p>
      No cookies are set on this domain. On occasion I use <a
        href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a
      > in my <a href="/words">posts</a> for demos, which may attempt to set 3rd
      party cookies (hopefully your browser prevents that from happening).
    </p>
    <p>
      This website does leverage the localStorage API to persist some
      preferences you might have set, like setting and persisting your preferred
      colour scheme across sessions for example.
    </p>
    <p>This website doesn't collect any analytics.</p>
    <h2 id="contact-form-submissions">Contact Form Submissions</h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      In order to request a copy of any data you have submitted via the contact
      form, or if you'd like to request a deletion of any data you've submitted
      via the content form, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> via your preferred
      medium and I'll be happy to oblige.
